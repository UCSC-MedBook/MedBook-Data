# Wrangler

Wrangler imports several data types into the MedBook database.

## Supported data types

### Patient/sample mapping table

This type of file tells MedBook about a new patient and/or a new sample.
Without this mapping file, new data cannot be imported into MedBook.

[Here is an example patient sample mapping file.](/example-files/patient_sample_mapping.tsv)
