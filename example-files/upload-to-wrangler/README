Upload to Wrangler

This is an example script for uploading a file to be imported as a Wrangler
 submission. For details, see the example configuration file "example.conf".

Usage Overview

./uploadToWrangler.py SAMPLENAME

This will upload the chosen file to Wrangler and, once completed, will display
the ID that it has been assigned. For example:

Blob ID for import to Wrangler:
{"_id":"AbCdEfGh12345"}

On Wrangler's Submissions / Edit page, you will see a field with the prompt
"Enter blob ID". Enter into this field the ID you received; in this example,
the ID is AbCdEfGh12345. Then, click the "Import blob" button and the uploaded
file will be attached to that Wrangler submission.
